# React Quiz

In this activity, we will begin by installing a few helpful packages and then explore the React documentation to answer questions.

## Instructions

### Part 1

* Begin installing both the Create React App and Yarn packages globally by running the following command in your terminal:

`npm install -g create-react-app yarn`

### Part 2

* While those are installing, work with your group to answer each of the following questions using the [ReactJS Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/):

1. In the previous section we just installed two packages, Create React App and Yarn. What are they for?

    Create React App:
        - officially supported
        - lets you build single-page React applications
        - a modern build setup
        - no configuration required

    Yarn:
        - tool to manage your dependencies (packages)
        - caches every package so it's very fast
        - integrity checks mean security
        - guarantees that a working install on one machine works the same way on other machines

2. What are some benefits of using ReactJS?

    - easy to build interactive UIs
    - component-based
    - virtual DOM makes rendering more efficient 

3. What is a React component? Hint: Check the "Components and Props" section of the React documentation.

    React Components: encapsulated, reusable pieces of code that you can think about in isolation.
    "Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen."

4. What is the significance of the `ReactDOM.render` method? Hint: Check the "ReactDOM" section of the documentation.

    ReactDOM.render: https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render

5. What is JSX? Why does Facebook recommend using it? Hint: Check the "Introducing JSX" section of the documentation.

    JavaScript syntax

6. What does Facebook recommend as the “best way to start building a new React single page application”? Hint: Check the "Installation" section of the React documentation.

7. What is Babel? And what role does it play in converting JSX into vanilla JavaScript? Hint: Check the "Introducing JSX" section of the documentation.

8. What is the significance of { } curly braces in JSX? Hint: Check the "Introducing JSX" section of the documentation.
